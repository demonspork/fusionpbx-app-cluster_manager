This app is used when you are using Route53 for DNS and dsiprouter as a session border controller handling incoming dids from your carrier.
It may be expanded in the future for more advanced useage of route53 and other dns providers, as well as handling other sbcs

The SBC Status column is for the fusionpbx destinations, showing how many of the total exist in the session border controller. 
Clicking "UPDATE" will take any checked domains and 
1) Create a CNAME record for that domain pointing to the fully qualified domain name of the server that was selected in the dropdown.
2) Create SRV Records for tcp/tls/udp pointing to the fqdn of the selected server
3) Any "Destinations" that exist in fusionpbx will be sent to the configure dsiprouter instance and pointed at the configured endpoint group or endpoint id.
Once dsiprouter has been updated, you have to reload kamailio and it will tell you at the top of the page if it needs to be reloaded.

Installation: 
To install, clone the repository, copy to /var/www/fusiopnbx/app/cluster_manager, run app defaults and permission defaults, configure default settings for dsiprouter api, create aws-config.php in /etc/fusionpbx containing the following with your AWS API key and secret with permissions to edit the correct hostedzone.
